# Final Project Ironhack Dec2021
## Fake News Detector

### Objective
Train and test a model that can **detect if a given news article is reliable or not**

### Dataset
Training data is from kaggle and contains **20,800 news articles in 5 columns** (id, title, author, text, label[1=unreliable and 0=reliable]) â†’ the classes are balanced

Data also contains a test file with 5,200 articles excluding the label

### Method
Using NLP preprocessing to make text available for categorization models and compare the results. I will optimize the models by using Tdidf Vectors, NLTK Taggers and hyperparameter tuning.
